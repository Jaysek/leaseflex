      <p>
        If you need to leave your apartment before your lease ends, finding someone to take
        over your lease is often the <strong>cheapest and cleanest way out</strong>. Instead
        of paying thousands in early termination fees, you hand the keys to a qualified
        replacement and walk away.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it&apos;s not as simple as posting on Craigslist and hoping for the best.
        Here&apos;s the full process — from finding a replacement to getting your landlord
        on board.
      </p>

      <h2>Sublease vs. Lease Assignment: Know the Difference</h2>
      <p>
        These two terms get used interchangeably, but they are very different legally:
      </p>

      <h3>Sublease</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You stay on the lease as the primary tenant</li>
        <li>The subletter pays you, and you pay the landlord</li>
        <li><strong>You are still responsible</strong> if the subletter doesn&apos;t pay</li>
        <li>Your landlord&apos;s relationship is still with you, not the subletter</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Lease Assignment (Takeover)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The new tenant <strong>replaces you on the lease entirely</strong></li>
        <li>They sign a new agreement with the landlord</li>
        <li>You are fully released from liability</li>
        <li>This is the better option if you want a clean break</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Always push for a lease assignment over a sublease.</strong> With a sublease,
        you&apos;re still on the hook if anything goes wrong. With an assignment, you&apos;re
        done.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 1: Check Your Lease</h2>
      <p>
        Before you start looking for a replacement, read your lease for language about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Subletting/assignment clauses:</strong> Does your lease allow it? Some
          leases explicitly prohibit it, others require landlord approval, and some are
          silent on the topic.</li>
        <li><strong>Landlord consent requirements:</strong> Most leases that allow subletting
          require written landlord approval first.</li>
        <li><strong>Fees:</strong> Some leases charge a subletting or assignment fee
          ($100–$500 is typical).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Even if your lease says &quot;no subletting,&quot; your landlord may still agree to
        a lease assignment. It&apos;s worth asking — the worst they can say is no.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 2: Talk to Your Landlord</h2>
      <p>
        Don&apos;t find a replacement tenant first and then surprise your landlord. Have the
        conversation upfront. Frame it as a benefit to them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>&quot;I need to move, but I want to make sure you have no gap in rent.&quot;</li>
        <li>&quot;I&apos;d like to find a qualified replacement rather than just breaking the lease.&quot;</li>
        <li>&quot;You&apos;ll get a pre-screened tenant with no vacancy period.&quot;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most landlords prefer this over the alternative (vacancy, legal proceedings, lost
        rent). Get their approval criteria: do they want to run their own background check?
        What&apos;s the minimum credit score or income requirement?
      </p>

      <h2>Step 3: Find a Replacement Tenant</h2>
      <p>
        Cast a wide net. Here are the best places to find someone:
      </p>

      <h3>Online Platforms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Facebook Marketplace</strong> — Post in local housing and apartment groups. This is often the fastest channel.</li>
        <li><strong>Craigslist</strong> — Still one of the highest-traffic sites for apartment seekers.</li>
        <li><strong>Leasebreak.com</strong> — A platform specifically designed for lease takeovers.</li>
        <li><strong>SwapALease</strong> — Another dedicated lease transfer marketplace.</li>
        <li><strong>Apartments.com / Zillow</strong> — Some allow lease takeover listings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Local Channels</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your building&apos;s community board or resident group chat</li>
        <li>University housing boards (if near a campus)</li>
        <li>Workplace Slack channels or internal message boards</li>
        <li>Friends, family, and social media — post to your own networks</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Writing a Good Listing</h3>
      <p>Include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rent amount and what&apos;s included (utilities, parking, etc.)</li>
        <li>Lease end date</li>
        <li>Move-in date availability</li>
        <li>Apartment size, photos, and neighborhood highlights</li>
        <li>Any perks (in-unit laundry, pet-friendly, gym, etc.)</li>
        <li>Be upfront that this is a lease takeover, not a new listing</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 4: Screen Candidates</h2>
      <p>
        Your landlord will run their own screening, but pre-screen candidates yourself
        to save time:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask about their income (generally should be 3x rent)</li>
        <li>Ask about their credit score range</li>
        <li>Ask for references from previous landlords</li>
        <li>Meet them in person if possible — you&apos;re handing over your home</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Only send qualified candidates to your landlord. If the first person they send
        gets rejected, landlords get skeptical fast.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 5: Complete the Transfer</h2>
      <p>
        Once your landlord approves the replacement:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The new tenant signs a lease (either a new lease or an assignment agreement)</li>
        <li>You sign a release from your lease obligations</li>
        <li>Handle the security deposit transfer (varies — sometimes the new tenant pays
          a new deposit and you get yours back; sometimes they reimburse you directly)</li>
        <li>Set a move-out / move-in date</li>
        <li>Do a walkthrough with photos before handing over keys</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>The most important document:</strong> A signed release from your landlord
        stating you are no longer responsible for the lease. Without this, you may still
        be liable if the replacement tenant defaults.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Pitfalls</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Doing it without landlord approval.</strong> If your lease requires
          consent and you sublet without it, you&apos;re violating the lease — which can
          lead to eviction for both you and the subletter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Not getting a written release.</strong> If you do a sublease without a
          formal assignment, you&apos;re still on the hook. Get released in writing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Overpricing the takeover.</strong> If you charge a &quot;finder&apos;s
          fee&quot; or mark up the rent, you&apos;ll struggle to find takers and may
          violate local subletting laws.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Waiting too long.</strong> Start looking immediately. Finding a qualified
          replacement can take 2–6 weeks.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cost Savings: Takeover vs. Breaking the Lease</h2>
      <p>
        Here&apos;s a quick comparison for a $2,000/month apartment with 6 months left:
      </p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Scenario</th>
            <th>Cost</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Break the lease (2-month penalty)</td>
            <td>$4,000+</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Lease takeover (assignment fee only)</td>
            <td>$200–$500</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>You save</strong></td>
            <td><strong>$3,500+</strong></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        The time investment is real (posting, screening, coordinating with landlord), but
        saving $3,500+ is worth a few weeks of effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who want to skip the uncertainty entirely, lease-break coverage like
        LeaseFlex can cover termination penalties upfront — but if you have the time,
        finding a replacement tenant is usually the most cost-effective route.
      </p>

      <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
      <p>
        A lease takeover is the best way to exit a lease without paying thousands in
        penalties. The process takes effort — checking your lease, getting landlord approval,
        finding and screening candidates — but the savings are significant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start early, cast a wide net, and always get your release from the lease in writing.
