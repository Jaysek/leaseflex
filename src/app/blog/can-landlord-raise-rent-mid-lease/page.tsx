      <p>
        You signed a lease at $1,800/month. Six months in, your landlord sends a notice
        saying rent is going up to $2,100. Can they do that?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Short answer: Almost certainly not.</strong> A fixed-term lease is a binding
        contract, and your landlord generally cannot change the rent amount until the lease
        expires. But there are exceptions — and knowing when a rent increase is legal (and
        when it&apos;s not) can save you a lot of money and stress.
      </p>

      <h2>When a Landlord CANNOT Raise Rent</h2>

      <h3>During a Fixed-Term Lease</h3>
      <p>
        If you have a <strong>standard 12-month lease</strong> (or any fixed-term lease),
        the rent amount is locked for the duration of the lease. Your landlord agreed to a
        specific price when you both signed the contract, and they are bound by that
        agreement just like you are.
      </p>
      <p>
        A mid-lease rent increase on a fixed-term lease is a <strong>breach of
        contract</strong>. You are within your rights to refuse it, continue paying the
        original amount, and point to your signed lease as evidence.
      </p>

      <h3>In Rent-Controlled or Rent-Stabilized Units</h3>
      <p>
        If you live in a <strong>rent-controlled or rent-stabilized unit</strong>, additional
        protections apply. These regulations cap how much rent can increase and when. Major
        cities with some form of rent regulation include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>New York City</li>
        <li>San Francisco</li>
        <li>Los Angeles</li>
        <li>Washington, D.C.</li>
        <li>Oakland</li>
        <li>Portland, Oregon</li>
        <li>Parts of New Jersey</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In these areas, even at lease renewal, your landlord may only be able to raise rent
        by a fixed percentage (often 3–10% per year, tied to the CPI or a rent board
        guideline).
      </p>

      <h3>As Retaliation</h3>
      <p>
        In most states, landlords cannot raise rent (or threaten a raise) as retaliation
        for a tenant exercising their legal rights — like requesting repairs, reporting
        code violations, or organizing with other tenants. Retaliatory rent increases are
        illegal, and tenants who can prove retaliation often have strong legal claims.
      </p>

      <h2>When a Landlord CAN Raise Rent</h2>

      <h3>At Lease Renewal</h3>
      <p>
        When your lease term ends and you&apos;re offered a renewal, your landlord can
        propose a new rent amount. In most states (outside rent-controlled areas), there
        is <strong>no legal limit on how much rent can increase</strong> at renewal.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where many renters get hit: a sudden $200–$500/month increase at renewal
        time. You can negotiate, but ultimately your options are to accept, negotiate, or
        move.
      </p>

      <h3>On a Month-to-Month Tenancy</h3>
      <p>
        If you are on a <strong>month-to-month lease</strong> (either by choice or because
        your fixed-term lease expired and rolled over), your landlord can raise rent with
        proper notice — usually 30 to 60 days, depending on your state.
      </p>

      <h3>If Your Lease Has an Escalation Clause</h3>
      <p>
        Some leases include a <strong>rent escalation clause</strong> that allows for
        mid-lease increases under specific conditions — for example, annual adjustments
        tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), or an increase after a set period. If
        you signed a lease with this language, the increase is legal as long as it follows
        the terms of the clause.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Always read the fine print before signing.</strong> If there&apos;s an
        escalation clause, you should know about it upfront.
      </p>

      <h2>What to Do If Your Landlord Tries to Raise Rent Mid-Lease</h2>

      <h3>1. Check Your Lease</h3>
      <p>
        Pull out your lease and read it. Look for the rent amount, the lease term (start
        and end dates), and any clauses about rent adjustments. If the lease says $1,800/month
        for 12 months and there&apos;s no escalation clause, you&apos;re protected.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Respond in Writing</h3>
      <p>
        Send your landlord an email (not a text, not a phone call — email creates a paper
        trail). Politely but firmly reference your lease:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        &quot;Per our signed lease agreement dated [date], the monthly rent is $1,800
        for the lease term ending [date]. I do not agree to a mid-term rent increase
        and will continue paying the agreed-upon amount.&quot;
      </blockquote>

      <h3>3. Continue Paying the Original Rent</h3>
      <p>
        Pay your original rent amount on time. Do not pay the increased amount — if you
        do, it may be interpreted as acceptance of the new terms. Keep records of every
        payment.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Contact a Tenant Rights Organization</h3>
      <p>
        If your landlord persists or threatens consequences, contact a local tenant rights
        organization or legal aid society. Many offer free consultations. In many cities,
        there are tenant hotlines you can call for immediate advice.
      </p>

      <h3>5. File a Complaint</h3>
      <p>
        If your landlord attempts to enforce an illegal rent increase — through threats,
        harassment, or filing for eviction — you can file a complaint with your local
        housing authority or tenant protection board.
      </p>

      <h2>How Much Can Rent Increase at Renewal?</h2>
      <p>
        In most of the U.S. (outside rent-controlled areas), there is <strong>no legal cap
        on rent increases at renewal</strong>. Your landlord can technically raise rent from
        $1,800 to $2,500 if the market supports it. The only constraint is what the market
        will bear — if they price it too high, they&apos;ll lose tenants.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice, most landlords raise rent 3–8% per year. A $100–$150/month increase
        on a $2,000 apartment is common. Anything above 10% in a single year is aggressive
        and worth negotiating.
      </p>

      <h2>Should You Negotiate or Move?</h2>
      <p>
        When faced with a big rent increase at renewal, do the math:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Cost of the increase over 12 months:</strong> A $200/month increase =
          $2,400/year.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cost of moving:</strong> New deposits, movers, application fees, overlap
          rent — typically $2,000–$5,000+.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Inconvenience factor:</strong> Moving is stressful, time-consuming, and
          disruptive.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If the increase is less than the cost of moving, it often makes financial sense to
        stay and negotiate a smaller increase. If the increase is so large that your new
        rent is no longer affordable, moving is the rational choice — but factor in all
        the costs of relocating.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a big renewal increase motivates you to move and you still have time on your
        lease, products like LeaseFlex can cover the cost of leaving early so you&apos;re
        not trapped by the calendar.
      </p>

      <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>No, your landlord generally cannot raise rent during a fixed-term
        lease.</strong> If they try, check your lease, respond in writing, continue paying
        the original amount, and contact a tenant rights organization if needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        At lease renewal, rent increases are legal in most areas with no cap. Your best
        defense: negotiate, know your market, and be prepared to walk if the numbers
        don&apos;t work.
